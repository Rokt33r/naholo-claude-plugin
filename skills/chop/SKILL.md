description: Draft a CHOP proposal for splitting the currently infilled Naholo operation. Writes `notes/CHOP.md` showing how WARNING ORDER.Constraints and OPERATION ORDER tasks split between the current OP and a proposed new OP, for user review. No server calls, no pruning — `/chopchop` applies the proposal once the user is satisfied.
argument-hint: '"freeform — what to carve off"'

Run `naholo agent skills chop` and follow stdout.

If `naholo` is not found or the command errors, tell the user to run `/naholo-doctor` to diagnose and fix the CLI setup, then stop.
